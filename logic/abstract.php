                    This project is a collection of fascinating results, application and theory through the scope of logic, computing and reasoning.
                    It serves as a detailed guide on using and extending many of the concepts in the book <i>An Introduction to Mathematical Logic</i> by Richard E. Hodel.
                    This project also tries to fill in a lot of details and simplify a lot of the concepts to the reader. The relationship to other fields
                    of Mathematics is also explored in great detail. The details of the Book are also of fundamental importance to understand the ideas of
                    mathematical logic and to understand it's applciations as well as its limitations. Non-classical approaches to logic are also considered and discussed in detail.
                    We further explore modal logic as well as the (typed/untyped) lambda calculus.
