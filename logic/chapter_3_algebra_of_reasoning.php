                Cantor's Diagonal Argument raised a lot of suspicion about the foundations of mathematics.
                
                Contemporaries of Cantor expanded on his ideas of set theory as the simplest way to encode the idea of "relation" into a mathematical or even a natural language has to offer.
                
                To extend the logic of the day to a relational logic, a world in which a sense of "classification" or "belonging to a group of objects" can be established amongst one another.
                An axiom that permits to perform arithetic.
                
                These ideas have all been encoded into set theoretic symbols by Peano and Dedekind, other conemporaries at the time in which Kuratowski proved ideas in graph theory which related to the ideas in logic (Graph Theory being the kid on the block).
                This idea has long been confirmed and will also be illustrated in one of the example below. This fact can be illustrated as an Example:
                
                
                
                to carry such explicit and precise meaning all while keeping the Algebra of Boole in the back of your mind.
                
                The set theoretic intepretation of Boole's Algebra is also very easily stated, while it's logical version also holds. This is the same chain of thought which gave rise to the boolean algebra and the

                        This is a proof. The proof starts with a simple assumption and then uses logical reasoning to arrive at the conclusion. Different techniques of reasoning may be employed when trying to prove a specific statement. Rules of inference include Modus Ponens, Modus, Tollens, etc.
